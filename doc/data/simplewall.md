# Data - simplewall

[simplewall](https://github.com/henrypp/simplewall) is a simple tool to configure Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) which can configure network activity on your computer.

This application is basically a firewall using by default the spy rules of WindowsSpyBlocker embedded in the `blocklist.xml` file.

You can integrate data specifically generated for simplewall from [`data/simplewall`](../../data/simplewall) by copying the `blocklist.xml` file to the simplewall root folder.

Here is an example with the `blocklist.xml` from `data/simplewall/spy/blocklist.xml` :
