# Data - Firewall

Some queries use IP addresses but you can stop them with your Firewall.

All relative information about these IP addresses are listed in the CSV files `firewall-` in [logs folder](../../logs).

To add/remove firewall rules or test IPs, read the instructions on the [app/telemetry/firewall](../app/telemetry/firewall.md) page.
