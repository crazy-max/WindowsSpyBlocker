# Data - Hosts

Copy/paste the content of files in [`data/hosts`](../../data/hosts) in your Windows hosts file located in `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`.

You can use the [HostsMan](http://www.abelhadigital.com/hostsman) freeware (or its [portable release](https://github.com/portapps/hostsman-portable)) to keep update your hosts file.
